# Shared docker compose resolution for scripts that talk to the running
# hydra-headless-ts / mariadb-mcp stack. Sourced, not executed.
#
# There is no single default docker-compose.yml + project any more:
#
#   * A deployed host (salt/hydra-headless-ts's init.sls, in the salt repo)
#     starts the stack via /etc/init.d/hydra-mcp with
#       -f /src/hydra-headless-ts/docker-compose.yml
#       -f /etc/hydra-headless-ts/docker-compose.mariadb-mcp.<env>.yml
#       -p hydra-mcp
#     (see that script's PATHS/OPTS). docker-compose.yml pins `name: hydra`,
#     so a *bare* `docker compose` in a checkout there resolves to project
#     "hydra" -- a different project than the one actually running -- so
#     `ps`/`exec` silently miss the real containers, and `up` starts a
#     second, conflicting stack.
#   * A local dev checkout has no /etc/init.d/hydra-mcp; LOCAL_TESTING.md's
#     documented `-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mariadb-mcp.dev.yml`
#     (project "hydra", from docker-compose.yml's own `name:`) is what's
#     running.
#
# Auto-detect which of those this host is, rather than requiring a flag.
