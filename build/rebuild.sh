# almost none of the *contents*. Three ways that diverges:
#
#   - Unpushed commits: the clone gets older code than the HEAD whose SHA is
#     baked into BUILD_HASH, so the published tag names a commit the image does
#     not contain.

#   - Uncommitted build/entrypoint.sh: the opposite -- that one file *is* COPYed
#     from the local context, so the image matches no commit anywhere.
#
# Comparing origin's tip against GIT_COMMIT is the check that matters; it also
# catches a branch that was never pushed, which would otherwise fail the clone
